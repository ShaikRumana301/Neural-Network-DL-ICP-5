# Neural-Network-DL-ICP-5


When we compare the Naïve Bayes and SVM both read the glass.csv data set and x_train has all the data except for type column data and y_train had only type column data x_train and y_train has been divided into 80:20 ratio. Declared naive Bayes ML algo in Code 1 and SVM method for Code 2, to fit and train data. Following the training, predictions are made, and the results are stored in y_pred, with the actual data available in y_test.
After running both the methods and comparing the accuracy, we can say that Naïve Bayen has performed better than the SVM method because The Naive Bayes algorithm is more accurate and efficient on large data sets since the space complexity and time are less when compared to the SVM method.
